# dotfiles

Dotfiles for my Arch Linux system.

All files in the repository root are files from the home
directory (`$HOME`). All directories except the `.zsh` directory in the
repository root are from the `$HOME/.config` directory. The `.zsh` directory
resides in `$HOME` and it's where all my `zsh`-related files are present.
